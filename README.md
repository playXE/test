# libimmixcons
Implementation of Immix Mark-Region Garbage collector written in Rust Programming Language.

# Status
This is mostly usable library. You can use this library inside your programs or VM implementation safely.

- Threading support when built with `threaded` option.
- Trap based safepoints for almost zero overhead.
- Conservative stack scanning and precise on heap scanning.
- Opportunistic evacuation of fragmented blocks.
- C API in `libimmixcons.h`. 

# TODO
- More documentation and more examples.
- More benchmarks.
- ~~I want more power!~~ Improve performance as it is not at its peak right now.
     

     To win BDWGC in benchmarks we have to disable unmapping blocks after each GC cycle. To beat it in regular programs
     we have to implement chunk allocation so we can unmap chunks of blocks rathern than each block individually.


# Examples
For examples look in `examples/` directory and for usage of C API take a look at `example.c`.
